Title: Handling APIs of JSONPlaceholderAPI

Description: JSONPlaceholderAPI is a RESTful API that provides fake data for testing and prototyping. As a Flutter developer, your task is to handle the APIs of JSONPlaceholderAPI by integrating them into a Flutter application. The application should display the data provided by the API and handle any errors that may occur during network calls.

Tasks:

Familiarize yourself with JSONPlaceholderAPI: Before starting to integrate the API into your Flutter application, you should understand the structure of the API and the data it provides. You can find the documentation of the API on the JSONPlaceholderAPI website.

Set up the project: Create a new Flutter project and set up the necessary dependencies for handling network calls. You can use packages like dio for making API calls.

Fetch data from the API: Use the dio package to fetch data from the API. You can start by fetching a single resource, such as a post or a user, and display it in the application.

Parse JSON data: The data returned by the API is in JSON format. You need to parse the JSON data and convert it into Dart objects that can be used in your Flutter application. You can use the dart: to convert the library to parse the JSON data.

Display the data: Once you have fetched and parsed the data, you can display it in the application. You can use Flutter widgets such as ListView, GridView, or Card to display the data.

Handle errors: Network calls can fail due to various reasons such as a bad internet connection or a server error. You need to handle these errors gracefully in your Flutter application by displaying an error message or a retry button.

Implement pagination: JSONPlaceholderAPI provides pagination for fetching large amounts of data. You can implement pagination in your Flutter application by fetching data in chunks and displaying it in a paginated manner.

Deliverables:

A Flutter application that integrates JSONPlaceholderAPI and displays the data provided by the API.

The application should handle errors that may occur during network calls.

The application should implement pagination for fetching large amounts of data.

Code documentation and comments that explain the implementation details.

A written report that describes the implementation process and any challenges faced during the development.
